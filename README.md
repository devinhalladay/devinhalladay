### Hi, I'm Devin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a multi-disciplinary senior designer based in NYC, specializing in software design and engineering. Focused on next-generation tools for creativity and work.

Currently, I am a designer + engineer at Replit. Before that, I co-founded Manhattan Hydraulics, a product studio within Garden3D and a partner to Sanctuary Computer and XXIX. I was also Head of Product at Index, and a product designer at Palantir, Quora, Friends of the Web, and 64 Robots.
